Conventionally, meta tags can be divided into three groups:

1. containing control commands for the browser;
2. containing control commands for search engines;
3. containing information about the page and its author.

1 - Meta tags containing control commands for the browser
There are few such meta tags, but these are by far the most important of the meta tags.
The fact that this meta tag is intended to control the browser,
says the http-equiv attribute.

Content-type - this meta tag tells the browser what encoding the page is made in.
Content-Language - The meta tag tells what language the page is written in.
pragma - this meta tag prevents the browser from caching the page (that is, storing it in memory).
refresh - This meta tag is N seconds after the current page is loaded into the browser,
will reload the URL page instead (naturally, instead of N
a number should be written - the number of seconds, and instead of a URL - the correct address of the page).

        <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=windows-1251" />
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Language" content="en" />
        <meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache" />
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5; url=002_HTTP-Equip.htm" />


2 - Meta tags containing information about the page and its author
Generator - tells what program was used to generate the page code.
site-created - specifies the date the page was created.
expires - This meta tag indicates when the page will be deleted.
Author - contains the name of the author of the page.
Copyright - indicates the owner of the copyright.
Reply-to - specifies how to contact the author of the page.
Owner - specifies the owner of the page.
Address - contains the address of the author of the page.

        <title>Meta tags containing information about the page and its author</title>
        <meta name="Generator" content="Visual Studio" />
        <meta name="site-created" content="01/01/2020" />
        <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Fri, 16 April 2020 23:59:59 GMT" />
        <meta name="Author" content="Bill" />
        <meta name="Copyright" content="Alex Corp" />
        <meta name="Reply-to" content="Bill@ua" />
        <meta name="Owner" content="Bill />
        <meta name="Address" content="Bill" />
        
3 - Meta tags containing control commands for search engines

description - contains the main description of the page, is the most important of the meta tags.
keywords - contains the keywords for which the page will be indexed.
robots - meta tag controls page indexing.
        index / noindex - index / not index this page;
        follow / nofollow - follow / do not follow links from this page;
        all - equivalent to index, follow
        none - equivalent to noindex, nofollow
        revisit, revisit-after - instructs the search engine to index the site at the desired frequency.

        <meta name="description" content="HTML examples" />
        <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, XML, XHTML, JavaScript, VBScript" />
        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
        <meta name="revisit" content="3 days" />
        <meta name="revisit-after" content="3 days" />
